# WebClones

In this repository I'll share random website clones using raw HTML and CSS. This **Web Clone** are part of the Front End assignmints in Factoria F5 Full Stack Developement Bootcamp. Frameworks are not allowed. 

The point of this repo is to track my improvements in Front End. The first web clone I did was pretty rudimental, the elements' position changed from screen to screen, I remember not being able to made the footer look as I wanted and, of course, it wasn't responsive at all.

With time, practice and some knowledge of media queries, preprocessors such as Sass and other tools, my web clones will look better.

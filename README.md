# WebClones

This repo's aim is to share weclone/replicas of webistes and landing pages using only HTML and CSS. These **WebClone**s are part of the Front-End assignmints in **Factoria F5** Full Stack Developement Bootcamp. The useage of frameworks are not allowed. 

The point of this repo is to track my improvements in Front End. The first web clone I did was pretty rudimental, the elements' position changed from screen to screen, I remember not being able to made the footer look as I wanted and, of course, it wasn't responsive at all.

With time and practice, though, I expect my webclones to be way better. 

#### Webclones:

1. [Digital Elite](https://solive93.github.io/webclone/digital-elite); First web replica. Getting started with HTML and CSS. I used a clip-path to cut the image into this trapezoid shape.
2. [Smart SEO](https://solive93.github.io/webclone/smart-seo); > 
3. [Ikae](https://solive93.github.io/webclone/ikae); Fake swedish furniture e-commerce in which I digged deeper in the use of grid system. I also used media queries.
4. [Throne](https://solive93.github.io/webclone/thone); Figuring out how flexbox behaves and getting started with Sass.
